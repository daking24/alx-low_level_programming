# C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I learned about the syntax of functions and how to nest loops in C. Also, I practiced creating functions and calling them to carry out operations. Additionally, I practiced nested loops and learned their importance.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

| File                     | Prototype                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `1-alphabet.c`           | `void print_alphabet(void);`     |


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. _putchar**
  * [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c): C program that prints `_putchar`,
  followed by a new line.
  	   * The program returns `0`.

* **1.I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.**
  * [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c): C program that prints all lowercase alphabets,
  followed by a new line.
