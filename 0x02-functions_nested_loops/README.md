# C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I learned about the syntax of functions and how to nest loops in C. Also, I practiced creating functions and calling them to carry out operations. Additionally, I practiced nested loops and learned their importance.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. _putchar**
  * [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c): C program that prints `_putchar`,
  followed by a new line.
  	   * The program returns `0`.
