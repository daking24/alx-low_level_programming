# C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I learned about the syntax of functions and how to nest loops in C. Also, I practiced creating functions and calling them to carry out operations. Additionally, I practiced nested loops and learned their importance.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

| File                     | Prototype                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `1-alphabet.c`           | `void print_alphabet(void);`     |
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | `void print_alphabet_x10(void);` |
| `3-islower.c`            | `int _islower(int c)`            |
| `4-isalpha.c`            | `int _isalpha(int c)`            |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. _putchar**
  * [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c): C program that prints `_putchar`,
  followed by a new line.
  	   * The program returns `0`.

* **1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.**
  * [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c): C program that prints all lowercase alphabets,
  followed by a new line.

* **2.10 x alphabet. **
  * [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c): C program that prints all lowercase alphabets 10 times,
  followed by a new line.

* **3. islower. **
  * [3-islower.c](./3-islower.c): C program that checks for lowercase characters.
    * The program returns `1` if it is lowercase.
    * The program returns `0` otherwise.

* **4.isalpha. **
  *[4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c); Cprogram that checks for alphabets characters.
  	* The program returns `1` if it is an alphabet.
	* The program returns `0` otherwise.

* **5. Sign. **
