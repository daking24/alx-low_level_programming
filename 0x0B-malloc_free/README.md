# C - malloc, free

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* Difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is `malloc` and `free` and how to use them
* Why and when to use `malloc`
* How to use `valgrind` to check for memory leak

## Description of what each file shows:
1. main.h - A library that includes fuction prototypes.
2. 0-create_array.c - A program that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
3. 1-strdup.c - A program that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
4. 2-str_concat.c - A program that concatenates two strings.
5. 3-alloc_grid.c - A program that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
6. 4-free_grid.c - a program that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by the `alloc_grid` program.
