* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

## Description of what each file shows:
1. main.h - A library that includes fuction prototypes.
2. 0-object_like_macro.h - A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
3. 1-pi.h - A header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
4. 2-main.c - A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
5. 3-function_like_macro.h - A function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
6. 4-sum.h - A function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
