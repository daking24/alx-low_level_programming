# C - File I/O

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* Look for the right source of information online
* How to create, open, close, read and write files
* What are file descriptors
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their `POSIX` names
* How to use the I/O system calls `open`, `close`, `read` and `write`
* What are and how to use the flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`
* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
* What is a system call
* What is the difference between a function and a system call

## Description of what each file shows:
1. main.h - Contains all prototypes of the programs in the folder.
2. 0-read_textfile.c - A program that reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output.
3. 1-create_file.c - A program that creates a file.
4. 2-append_text_to_file.c - A program that appends text at the end of a file.
5. 3-cp.c - A program that copies the content of a file to another file.
6. 100-elf_header.c - A program that displays the information contained in the `ELF` header at the start of an `ELF` file.
