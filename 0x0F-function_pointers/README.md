# C - Function pointers

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Description of what each file shows:
1. function_pointers.h - A header file that contains all the prototypes in this folder.
2. 0-print_name.c - A program that prints a name.
3. 1-array_iterator.c -  A program that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
4. 2-int_index.c - A program that searches for an integer.
5. [3-main.c, 3-op_funtions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h] - A program that performs simple operations.
