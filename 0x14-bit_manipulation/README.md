# C - Bit manipulation

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* Look for the right source of information without too much help.
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Description of what each file shows:
1. main.h - Contains all prototypes of the programs in the folder.
2. 0-binary_to_uint.c - A program that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.
3. 1-print_binary.c - A program that prints the binary representation of a number.
4. 2-get_bit.c - A program that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
5. 3-set_bit.c - A program that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.
6. 4-clear_bit.c - A program that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.
7. 5-flip_bits.c - A program that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
8. 100-get_endianness.c - A program that checks the endianness.
9. 101-password - The password for the given program in a task.
