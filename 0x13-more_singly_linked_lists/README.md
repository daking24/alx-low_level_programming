# C - More Singly linked lists

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* How to use linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Description of what each file shows:
1. lists.h - Contains all prototypes of the programs in the folder.
2. 0-print_listint.c - A program that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.
3. 1-listint_len.c - A program that returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list.
4. 2-add_nodeint.c - A program that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list.
5. 3-add_nodeint_end.c - A program that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list.
6. 4-free_listint.c - A program that frees a `listint_t` list.
7. 5-free_listint2.c - A program that frees a `listint_t` list.
8. 6-pop_listint.c - A program that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` linked list, and returns the head node's data (n).
9. 7-get_nodeint.c - A program that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` linked list.
10. 8-sum_listint.c - A program that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `listint_t` linked list.
11. 9-insert_nodeint.c - A program that inserts a new node at a given position.
12. 10-delete_nodeint.c - A program that deletes the node at index `index` of a `listint_t` linked list.
13. 100-reverse_listint.c - A program that reverses a `listint_t` linked list.
14. 101-print_listint_safe.c - A program that prints a `listint_t` linked list.
15. 102-free_listint_safe.c - A program that frees a `listint_t` list.
16. 103-find_loop.c - A program that finds the loop in a linked list.
