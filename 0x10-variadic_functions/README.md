## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* What are variadic functions
* How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
* Why and how to use the const type qualifier

## Description of what each file shows:
1. variadic_functions.h - Contains all prototypes of the programs in the folder.
2. 0-sum_them_all.c - A program that returns the sum of all its parameters.
3. 1-print_numbers.c - A program that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
4. 2-print_strings.c - A program that prints strings, followed by a new line.
5. 3-print_all.c - A program that prints anything.
