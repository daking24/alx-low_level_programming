# C - More malloc, free

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* How to use the `exit` function
* What are the functions `calloc` and `realloc` from the standard library and how to use them

## Description of what each file shows:
1. main.h - A library that includes fuction prototypes.
2. 0-malloc_checked.c - A program that allocates memory using `malloc`.
3. 1-str_nconcat.c - A program that concatenates two strings.
4. 2-calloc.c - A program that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`.
5. 3-array_range.c - A program that creates an array of integers.
