## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* How to use arguments passed to a program
* Types of prototypes od `main`
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)`

## Description of what each file shows:
1. main.h - A library that includes fuction prototypes.
2. 0-whatsmyname.c - A program that prints it's name, followed by a new line.
3. 1-args.c - A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
4. 2-args.c - A program that prints all arguments it receives.
5. 3-mul.c - A program that multiplies two numbers.
6. 4-add.c - a program that adds positive numbers.
