# C - Singly linked lists

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists

## Description of what each file shows:
1. lists.h - Contains all prototypes of the programs in the folder.
2. 0-print_list.c - A function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
3. 1-list_len.c - A function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
4. 2-add_node.c - A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
5. 3-add_node_end.c - A function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
6. 4-free_list.c - A function that frees a `list_t` list.
7. 100-first.c - A function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the main function is executed.
8. 101-hello_holberton.asm - A 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line.
